# Hang In There
---
A boilerplate repo.

## Introduction
---
* Sometimes you need a pick me up. Remember those motivational posters that were all over the place in classrooms and online? We’re going to make our own!

## Technologies
---
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Features
---
* When the page loads, the user should see a poster with a randomly selected image, title, and quote.

* Every time the user clicks the Show Random Poster button, a new random poster is displayed.

* When clicking the “Make Your Own Poster” button, the user should see the form, and the main poster should be hidden.

* When clicking the “View Saved Posters” button, the user should see the saved posters area, and the main poster should be hidden.

* When clicking the “Nevermind, take me back!” or “Back to Main” buttons, the user should only see the main poster section.

* On the new poster form view, users should be able to fill out the three input fields and then hit the Show My Poster button.

* When the Show My Poster button is clicked, future random posters can use the user-created data and display the newly created poster image, title, and quote in the main view on the DOM.

* When a user clicks the “Save This Poster” button, the current main poster will be added to the saved posters section.

* When clicking the “Save This Poster” more than once on a single poster, it will still only be saved once (no duplicates).

* When clicking the “Show Saved Posters” button, the user should see the saved posters section.

* All the saved posters should be displayed in the saved posters section.

* From the saved posters view, if a user double clicks a saved poster, it will be deleted.
